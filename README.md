# Kivy Spinning Bunnies
Kivy imperative rotation could only be better with bunnies--so I added them.

The purpose of this program is to demonstrate PushMatrix, Rotate, then PopMatrix, which is how to rotate something in Kivy, using purely imperative (Python) code (no declarative [kv language] code).
This code is a valuable start for making games.

##Usage:
* Tap if you like bunnies

##Release Notes
* (2015-03-05) First working version

##Known Issues
* layer widgets so that text appears on top regardless of how many sprite widgets are added to the canvas

##Credits
* This program was originally based upon https://gist.github.com/tshirtman/6222891 (however that program does rotation using declarative [kv language] code)
